Shortest Route for Multiple Destinations
Google Maps has zero route optimization features
Multi-Stop Route Optimization

The distinction here is that while Google Maps is a tool that can be used to find the shortest route between multiple stops, 
it was never designed to find the optimal order of those stops in your route. The person planning routes will need to plot addresses in Google Maps, 
and spend the time manually determining the most efficient order to serve them in. If you tell Google what order those stops should go in, 
you’ll get the best results possible for which roads to take; but you can’t ask it to provide the stop order for you.

Route Optimization further acts as a solution to two of the most difficult computer science problems: the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the VRP algorithm 
can also take into account complexities, like time windows, into its search for the optimal route.
